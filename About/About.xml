*Make sure there are no existing jobs, hediffs, or frames and (as always) employ [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2921585989]Mid-saver Saver[/url] to remove in the safest way possible.

This mod reworks a few existing frames for engineering consistency, tweaks the tech tree and unlock points, and adds a variety of extras.

Also includes code to ensure that the carrying capacity improvements from framework upgrades are applied to weight limits for all purposes including caravans.

[b]Altered Frames:[/b]
- Hydraulic (fixed carrying capacity bonus due to limitations of hydraulic actuators)
- Refined (increased pawn beauty and flat social impact buff from looking nice)
- Mobility (fixed movement speed bonus, again due to actual actuator functioning)

[b]Added Frames:[/b]
- Alignment Frame (hauling frame ideal for trainable mechanical animals)
- Thermal Pumped Frame (combat oriented upgrade to the Guardian Frame)
- Martial Frame (combat durability enhanced upgrade to the Mobility Frame)
- Advanced Alignment Frame (improved from above but spacer tech and much more expensive)
- Advanced Hydraulic Frame (as above; same scope of improvements and tech/cost changes)
- Noble Frame (more refined version of the Refined Frame with a focus on enhancing Nobility)

I am happy to add other unique frames if people want them.

[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]
[list]
[*]No known incompatibilities.*
[/list]

[u]The following mods are special cases:[/u]
*EdB Prepare Carefully eventually breaks all custom pawns; but that's their problem.
*Combat Extended does their own compatibility patches; this is fine if they're patched for ATR.

[b]Will this work with other older Android Tiers mods?[/b]
[i]No, ATR uses specific ATR tagged versions of things, which it calls upon to work.[/i]

[b]Can this be patched to work with other versions of Android Tiers?[/b]
[i]If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I have no intention of patching it myself though.[/i]

[b]Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?[/b]
[i]As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.[/i]
