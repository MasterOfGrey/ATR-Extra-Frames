# ATR-Extra-Frames
Designed for Rimworld 1.4

The main ATR maintains the noble and wise goal of balancing content and choice with gameplay experience.
Where there is room for more niche items not suitable to the design philosophy of the core mod, this mod is part of a set intended to enable those options for determined players.

## Features
This mod adds one additional mechanical frame (more in the future) to be used with the Android Tiers Reforged mod.

### Alignment Frame:
> Originally designed for the M.U.F.F. unit, but now seeing much greater use with the superior TORT, this frame aligns the components associated with the primary motor function elements of a creature - that of carrying "itself" (and its essentials) from A to B.
##### Stats:
* Carrying Capacity +90
* Movement Speed +1.6

I am happy to add other unique frames if people want them.

## Compatibility:
* Requires Android Tiers Reforged
* Safe to add to a save game, make sure there are no existing jobs or frames to remove it.
* No known incompatibilities - it'll just do nothing without ATR.

## Questions
[b]**Will this work with other older Android Tiers mods?**[/b]
[i]*No, ATR uses specific ATR tagged versions of things, which it calls upon to work.*[/i]

[b]**Can this be patched to work with other versions of Android Tiers?**[/b]
[i]*If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I have no intention of patching it myself though.*[/i]

[b]**Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?**[/b]
[i]*As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.*[/i]
