# ATR-Extra-Frames (Frames Reforged)
Designed for Rimworld 1.4

The main ATR maintains the noble and wise goal of balancing content and choice with gameplay experience.
Where there is room for more niche items not suitable to the design philosophy of the core mod, this mod is part of a set intended to enable those options for determined players.

## Features
This mod reworks a few existing frames for engineering consistency, tweaks the tech tree and unlock points, and adds a variety of extras.

### Altered Frames:
* Hydraulic (fixed carrying capacity bonus due to limitations of hydraulic actuators)
* Refined (increased pawn beauty and flat social impact buff from looking nice)
* Mobility (fixed movement speed bonus, again due to actual actuator functioning)

### Added Frames:
* Alignment Frame (hauling frame ideal for trainable mechanical animals)
* Thermal Pumped Frame (combat oriented upgrade to the Guardian Frame)
* Advanced Alignment Frame (improved from above but spacer tech and much more expensive)
* Advanced Hydraulic Frame (as above; same scope of improvements and tech/cost changes)

I am happy to add other unique frames if people want them.

## Recommended:
* Works best with ATR Industrial Automatons!

## Compatibility:
* Requires Android Tiers Reforged
* Safe to add to a save game, make sure there are no existing jobs or frames to remove it.
* No known incompatibilities - it'll just do nothing without ATR.

## Questions
> **Will this work with other older Android Tiers mods?**

No, ATR uses specific ATR tagged versions of things, which it calls upon to work.

> **Can this be patched to work with other versions of Android Tiers?**

If you make a patch, I'll happily add it in. I have no intention of patching it myself though.

> **Will you add the other localisations for other languages like ATR has?**

As above, if you would like to provide a localisation, I'll happily add it in.
